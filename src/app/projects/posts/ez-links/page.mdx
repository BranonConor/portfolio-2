# EZ Links @ Smartsheet

## Modernizing our linking UX for hackweek!

<MetadataBar date="May 2024" category="Hackweek" />

### ✍🏽 About Smartsheet

Smartsheet (NYSE: SMAR) is an industry-leading enterprise work management platform, boasting millions of passionate users!

The same project data can be dynamically viewed in various different ways (card/boards, timelines/gantt charts, and tables/grids). Content/asset management, workflows, mini-apps, dashboards, and more make for a robust CWM ecosystem capable of servicing large enterprise customers and small nimble customers alike.

### ⚠️ The Problem

- Links in the various views of the Smartsheet platform are a bit rough around the edges.
- Viewing a link in a kanban board, for example, requires you to click into the card, opening a side panel with full fields available. Once there, links (raw URL strings) are not clickable and you have to copy and paste them into new tabs to visit them.
- This creates inaccessible links buried deep in the UX, which is not ideal in a product where users need to add links everywhere.

### ✨ The Solution

- Assemble a hackweek team to build EZ Links 🔗, a rich-text solution that brings the linking UX in our products into the modern age!

### 👯‍♂️ The Hackweek Team

- 4 Senior Design Technologists (Including me 👋🏽)
- 1 product team engineer

# Hack the Sheet 2024 👨🏻‍💻

In all productivity tools, sharing links to external resources (docs, Figma specs, websites, etc.) is a CRUCIAL, high-frequency interaction. One of the best features ever is when you can simply copy a link, highlight text, hit paste and whatever you've highlighted becomes an inline link to that thing. SO good.

For Smartsheet's 2024 hackweek, I wanted to lead a team to implement this linking UX in our platform. As users of Smartsheet for project management during sprints and the like, this was personal 😈

The rest, coming soon... :)
