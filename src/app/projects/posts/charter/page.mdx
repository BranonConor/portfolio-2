# üé® Logo Redesign

### An Outdated Logo

The existing logo had some dated design elements. It also struggled as an effective symbol of the company, with ambiguous imagery and hard-to-read typography.

Some variants also existed with very non-coherent design/branding choices, some with odd color choices that have no cohesive purpose with the rest of the branding. Existing design assets were scattered and sometimes non-existence, with there being no real knowledge across the company of when/where/by whom these assets were created.

### Starting with the data

With little to work with, I decided it‚Äôd be best to start gathering a broad set of data:

- How do we feel about the existing logo?
- Who are we as a company in our own eyes?
- Who are we in the eyes of our partners and communities?

I learned a lot!

- No one likes the brown palette
- Many love the pink accent colors
- No one likes the current typography choices, they feel dated and unreadable
- We put compassion first
- Our patients see us as a hand to hold during difficult times
- Our partners trust us and see us as dependable
- With that trust and reputation, our existing logo has good recognition in the communities we serve

With a new and improved understanding of our brand and design preferences, I threw together 20+ first drafts. To start, I tried to focus on refreshing what existed. The VP of Marketing and I found this to be creatively limiting, and further surveys showed subpar reception to these iterations.

We grew bolder in our experimentation.

- Came up with the Charter Compass as a symbol that better embodies our mission
- Deepened the pink to make it more accessible
- Swapped out browns for blue shades to hearken to common healthcare branding
- Chose new typography for modernity, readability, and brand embodiment

The symbolism, design choices, and direction all excited the various stakeholders, from the Executive team to the Marketing team. Marketing began to work with HR, Legal, and more to plan out the new logo roll-out. In the meantime, I was ready to expand upon these design choices to create a design language and system.
