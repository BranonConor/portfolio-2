### ‚ö†Ô∏è The Problems

- We needed to help teams ship the new look and feel for the Smartsheet platform - our new and improved 'Ursa' theme!
- Switching over to the new theme for all teams at once would effectively be impossible üôÉ
- Thus, we needed a way to provide teams control over what theme they were rendering, so they can build and launch their experience in the new theme according to their own unique roadmaps/priorities.
- To do this, we needed to completely rethink and rebuild the current theming architecture. üëÄ

### ‚ú® The Solutions

- Learn about the current system - understand its tradeoffs, its pros and cons, etc.
- Architect a new solution that meets new requirements for the design system delivery across product teams, and propose how to bridge the gap from current state to future state.
- Ship it!

# üí≠ Introduction: A Huge Product Redesign Effort

When I first joined Smartsheet's Ursa Design System üêª team at the beginning of 2024, we were well on our way in shipping a complete redesign of the product. We were meeting with teams to discuss migration to our new design system theme, Ursa, and we were helping teams set expectations around level of effort based on the state of their code (teams had varying levels of design system adoption at this point). We refered to this effort as `Ursa-fication`.

Having just joined Smartsheet, my first task was to build a `‚ú® scoped theming system ‚ú®`, which would give product teams the ability to say "I want to be the old theme because I'm not ready for the new one" or "I want to be the new theme - I'm ready!". They needed this granular theming control because many teams didn't have enough design system adoption for us to simply flick the new theme on for everyone all at once - doing so before they were ready would result in a very scattered and inconsistent platform UX that we didn't feel would be acceptable.

Our current code allowed for global theming control, but with some unique constraints specific to the rest of our app architecture, so we had a long journey ahead of us to come up with a robust solution. Let's dive in! üê¨

<br />

# üìù Phase 1: Learn Stuff

I started by working to understand the current setup of our theming system in code. And if you know me by now, it should be no surprise that I started by cranking open a fresh Figjam file for an architecture diagram faster than you could say 'theme architecture refactor'! As I read through the code, I began to paint a picture of how things are currently working. Here's what I came up with:

<ContentImage
  image="/projects/theme-refactor/current-approach.svg"
  caption="A flowchart diagram of the current theme system in code"
/>

### Current theming system - global only! üåé

At a glance, we've got:

- `CommonTokenInjector` Component: it stores tons of tokens, for each of the 2 themes (the old one and our new one). It sets a `data-theme-key` attribute on the `<body />` in the DOM which corresponds to a theme name - it'll be referenced later. It also injects all the vars for whichever theme is active at the `:root` level.
- `useThemeKey()`: a hook to grab the `themeKey` string from the body element's `data-theme-key` attribute

The result is a global theme configuration at the page level, where components can use a hook to see what the current theme is. If they use valid semantic tokens, they'll get the values for the active theme via the `:root` level tokens, and if they need any non-tokenized styles they can conditionally render styles based on the theme key.

<Note>
  But this is the big problem ‚ÄºÔ∏è - if components currently look to the global
  theme, they don't have a system in place for scoped theming.
</Note>
<br />

### A first attempt at scoped theming üî¨

My first approach to scoped theming was to work within the confines of the current system - the path of least resistance. The idea was to have some similar stuff (see the purple box in the above diagram for the visual here):

- `ScopedTokenInjector` Component: behaves just like the `CommonTokenInjector` but sets a `data-theme-key` attribute on a `<div />` wrapper instead of the `<body />`, which all nested children can reference in that area of the app UI. And instead of injecting tokens at the `:root` level of the page, this injector will set tokens on the div as well, overriding the `:root` for any children of the div.

The rest is virtually the same as the current global solution - components use a hook to access the nearest parent with a `data-theme-key` attribute and that theme key will tell the component what styles / token values to render.

<Note>
  BUT - the new problem is: how do the components know what parent might have
  that attribute?
</Note>

Well, if you have the DOM element you can use the `element.closest()` method to find any parent with a particular selector, like so:

```jsx
//simplified example :)
const buttonComponent = document.querySelector("button");

buttonComponent.closest("[data-theme-key]");
```

Although this works, I began to recognize a couple problems here:

1. `.closest()` is not the most performant thing in the world if there are perhaps dozens, or even hundreds, of design system components on a page all looking to see what their current theme is. At worst this operation has a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of DOM nodes needed to traverse upward in the tree to find a parent element with a theme key.
2. In this approach, we're basically replicating the functionality of a React Context Provider ü§î And on the performance topic, a simple lookup of a context value by a child component is a mere `O(1)` time complexity operation, making it vastly more performant than the current iteration at scale.

Now, I began to think about the possibility of using context providers for theme delivery. But it seemed so obvious - why wasn't it already like that? Turns out there was a reason.

<br />

### A problem with Context Providers üòµ

The wider app architecture can give us some hints as to why we weren't currently using context providers. üò¨ Our frontend theming architecture was a bit more complex than I'd expected, and not very React-y. We have a special, pseudo-micro-services frontend app structure, where a bunch of product areas render themselves in separate React instances, all making their own `ReactDOM.render() calls!

```jsx
const SomePartOfTheProduct = () => {
  ...
  ReactDOM.render(
    <BunchOfReactComponents>
      ...
    </BunchOfReactComponents>
  );
}
```

Eventually, the entirety of the UI is comprised of these separate chunks of React code, stitched together (like different panels, navigations, dashboards, etc. which are usually owned by specific teams). This works - but it does make theming in a React app a bit complicated. If each piece of a page is made up of a bunch of separate `ReactDOM.render()` calls, you can't share any React context providers across those boundaries! They're entirely separate React trees. üòµ So it seems context providers were ruled out early on as a viable theming solution.

<Note>
  Thinking about it more, I wondered about a simple solution to this problem:
  what if each team just added a `ThemeProvider` at the top-level of their chunk
  of the code?
</Note>

This would allow for scoped theming in a more React-based approach, leveraging better performance and more predictability in our frontend code! Teams that aren't ready for the new `Ursa` theme can set their theme provider to the old theme, and teams that are all ready for the new theme can set it to an `ursa` theme key. From there, we can reconfigure components to use a `useTheme()` hook that makes a `useContext` call behind the scenes, to easily access the theme key in that sweet, sweet `0(1)` time.

I created a 'north star' architectural diagram for this new approach so we can see the moving parts at a glance and share it out to any stakeholders. Here's what I came up with:

<ContentImage
  image="/projects/theme-refactor/north-star.svg"
  caption="A flowchart diagram of the new, proposed theme system in code"
/>

You can already see how much simpler it is! After discussing this approach with the brilliant frontend minds at our company's biweekly `Frontend Guild` meeting, we had consensus that this would be a big improvement. Time to make it happen.

# üí™üèΩ Phase 2: Build out the new theming system!

### Building a ThemeProvider üé®

Refactor time! I started by creating a context provider for the theme. It sets the theme based on a prop, and each theme is just a big object with a bunch of important stuff for components to use:

- `themeKey`: a string that corresponds to one of the theme names
- `colors`, and other tokenized style values
- Eventually, the plan would be to add certain component styles to the theme object as well, which would set us up to ship custom theming for consumers and much more (like Material UI, Styled Components, and other standard theming systems!)

To take it one step at a time, we simply started by adding the `themeKey` field and some basic styles, etc. Components could then access the context provider values using a simple `useContext()` hook, and voila - instant access to the theme!

```jsx
// this is not real code, but rather a super
// simplified example of how the new system works :)
const DesignSystemButton = () => {
  //grab stuff from the theme!
  const { colors, themeKey } = useTheme();

  return (
    <button
      styles={{
        background: colors.button.default,
        borderRadius: themeKey === "ursa" ? "16px" : "6px",
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};

const AppSection = () => {
  return (
    //render a provider set to a specific theme
    <ThemeProvider theme="ursa">
      <DesignSystemButton>Submit</DesignSystemButton>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

### Unwinding dependencies and breaking stuff üõ†Ô∏è

Our design system code lives in a few different packages, and in order to get this right we'd have to shift around some of the imports/exports across these packages. Generally, the components need to access this theme provider and the theme provider needs to store certain tokens and other stuff, so to make it all work without circular dependencies, some rearranging was required. Can you take a wild guess at how I decided to start unwinding this stuff?

<ContentImage
  image="/projects/theme-refactor/deps.svg"
  caption="A flowchart diagram of the dependencies across packages in code"
/>

That's right - Figjam diagram üòåü§ù

With an approachable understanding of what different utilities, modules, styles, etc. are coming and going from what packages, I managed to move stuff around avoiding circular deps. It got quite complex - so many packages had tokens, utilities to read tokens, access theme values, ship test utilities that wrap tests in themes, and much more.

Unfortunately, at times this required copying and pasting certain utilities and whatnot across packages, adding deprecation warnings to them in their old locations. In doing this, we moved toward consolidating a lot more of our code in our `core` package, as opposed to separating certain concerns across packages, but we had consensus on our team that this was actually the favored approach. At times, we even felt we had a few too many packages anyway.

### Configuring components to use the theme provider üîå

Now it was time for the last piece of the puzzle - the components themselves! To get them working with the theme, we had to import and use the `useTheme()` hook to pull the `themeKey` off of the nearest parent `ThemeProvider`.

This part was cumbersome due to the number of components, but luckily the components were already rigged up to render all their styles based on that simple `themeKey` string, so we didn't have to do much else in the components to get them working!

<br />
<hr />
<br />

# üßπ Phase 3: Cleanup and ship!

With the theme provider in place, the deps sorted out, and the components all hooked up to the context provider, we had some final items to nail down.

### #Ô∏è‚É£ Versioning

We tooootally broke stuff along the way here, so these changes were inevitably requiring a major release of our design system for code consumers. It had been a while since our last major release so lucky for us, this one was somewhat timely, and we had plenty of conversations with engineers, product managers, and more to make sure this wouldn't be too disruptive to their current plans. Ultimately, it was time to ship this as a major release so folks could insulate their product area's theming!

We use [Changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to adhere to `semver` in our design system code, so we executed on this by creating a `V3` feature branch in code off of our `main` branch, contributing to it over time in various PRs, each with their own `changeset` files. By the time we were done, we had a single branch containing all of the aforementioned `V3` changes to the theming system, and we were ready to rock and roll.

### üìö Documentation

Before we could officially ship the changes though, we had to make sure we documented everything. This included a lot of different touchpoints, and we had to be thorough:

- Storybook: our Storybook instance is hosted and available internally for all product teams to reference. We made sure to update any theming setup examples with tons of info on our new `ThemeProvider` system.
- Docs Site: `Ursa` has a dedicated internal documentation site, so we made sure to add tons of thorough info on the new `ThemeProvider` in our `app setup/getting started` guides for developers.
- `V3` Migration Guide: we always spin up a migration doc to highlight what changes happened across what design system packages anytime we ship a major release. Here in our V3 doc, we highlighted to shifting of stuff across our packages, noting which ones you should/shouldn't use, and of course, how our new theming system works, with links to the architectural diagrams, code in our repo, and more.

### üö¢ SHIP IT

With all of these docs updated, we shipped our release and shared it out across tons of different Slack channels and more!

# üöÄ Outcomes

### ü§î Mysterious React bugs

As consumers began migrating to the new major version of the design system, some teams began to see super weird bugs around the `themeKey` from the `ThemeProvider` coming back `undefined`, despite them clearly and obviously adding in the `ThemeProvider` to their part of the app.

We had to put our heads together on this one. After tons of debugging, we solved this mystery after stumbling across some blogs on the web about `symbol names` in React. It turns out that despite each section of the UI code, divided by their separate `ReactDOM.render()` calls, all declaring their own `ThemeProvider` thus avoiding the loss of context across React boundaries, the components were actually getting confused as they look up their React tree, since each instance of React was declaring identical `ThemeProvider` symbol names üòµ‚Äçüí´

To solve this issue, we actually found an old utility in our codebase that initiates contexts and registers their symbol names in the `globalThis` object to avoid multiple instances of the same context symbol name. It appears engineers before us ran into similar issues given our unique frontend app infrastructure! üëÄ Instantiating the context provider with this special `createContext()` call stopped those issues for consumers.

### üß† Learnings

- Driving large, complex technical initiatives with large system-wide impact
- Understanding legacy systems and hammering out improved architectures
- Best practices with application UI theming, design tokens, etc.
- Grokking the deeper quirks of React, the DOM, browser APIs, and more

### üîÆ Future Work

Initially, we thought maybe taking a similar approach to Material UI, Styled Components, etc. in having a large centralized `baseTheme` object full of component styles, etc. would be a great architecture for us. With proper token layer systems in place, consumers could declare `customTheme` objects, passing them in to override and customize design system components, which would automagically pick up those changes.

However - we have a very CSS Variable-heavy token delivery as it is, and we decided to lean more into `Style Dictionary` to organize the delivery of our tokens and styles as stylesheets, leaning away from the javascript-y, object-based theme approach. More on that in a future post perhaps :)

# Conclusion

If you made it this far - wow, you're something special ‚≠êÔ∏è The result here was a completely overhauled theme delivery system that prioritzed React best-practices and conventions, performance, and developer experience. With this new major version of our design system, product teams had the power to declare exactly what theme they wanted their section of the app UI to render in. And from there, teams were able to slot `Ursa-fication` of their UI into their roadmaps at their own pace, empowering them with full prioritization freedom (within reason üòâ).

I hope you enjoyed this deep dive into one of the biggest projects of my career so far. It was an honor to drive technical direction [enabling Smartsheet to more gracefully dive into its new age](https://www.designrush.com/news/smartsheet-s-redesign-is-a-bold-leap-into-ai-accessibility-and-a-user-centered-experience).
