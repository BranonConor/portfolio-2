# Design Panel w/ SDSU + Friends of Figma

## Speaking to design students at SDSU about careers in tech!

<MetadataBar date="April 2022" category="Mentoring" />

### An Awesome Opportunity

I was kindly invited by the folks at Friends of Figma's San Diego chapter to join a panel of awesome UX professionals in town. We would be fielding questions from the moderator that guide us through talking about common career questions that our audience, the awesome UX Design students at San Diego State University, might have buzzing around their minds as they finish up their degrees and work toward graduation.

Our panel was recorded - check out the awesome conversations we had for yourself!
