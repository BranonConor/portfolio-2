### An Awesome Opportunity

I was kindly invited by the folks at Friends of Figma's San Diego chapter to join a panel of awesome UX professionals in town. We fielded questions and prompts from the moderator and talked about our careers. Our audience, the awesome UX Design students at San Diego State University, hopefully got some great insight into the industry and life in the design world. Afterwards, we got to network and answer questions that the students might have buzzing around their heads as they work toward graduating! It was super fun :)

Our panel was live streamed for remote viewers as well, and the recording was provided after - check out the awesome conversations we had for yourself!
