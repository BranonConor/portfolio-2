# Mentoring on ADPList

## Helping students, tech workers, and career switchers with all kinds of stuff!

<MetadataBar date="Feb 2024 - Now" category="Mentoring" />

### Opening up my Calendar

In the beginning of 2024, I decided to join ADPList as a mentor for anyone looking for tech career help! Until now, I'd been doing lots of mentoring in my own ways - I had a discord channel where I moderated a group of 20-30 folks learning how to code in bootcamps, self-taught journies, students, people practicing data structures and algorithms, aspiring UX designers, and more. It was super fun, but it was a bit hard to keep up with in an unstructured way.

I remembered seeing all kinds of folks joining ADPList and remembered that it existed, and thought, "Hey! This could be a nice way to manage my mentoring time with clearer boundaries." I signed up, and opened up my calendar for a little few hour time block one day a week.

### What I've been up to!

To my surprise, I immediately got some bookings and have been going pretty steady with sessions every week, and it's been SO much fun meeting so many different great folks. As a design technologist / UX engineer / design engineer (holy cow can we decide on one name lol), I've focused on offering help to people interested in UX/frontend careers. Gotta stay in your lane. Here's some stuff I've got to do so far:

- Helping career switchers looking to dive into tech structure their learning so they focus on the important things
- Doing resume and portfolio reviews for more junior designers and engineers
- Demystifying the 'UX Engineer'/'Design Technologist' niche and what type of things we do
- Helping current engineers and designers figure out how to be more savvy in one of the other respective disciplines
- Motivating and encouraging people who need a little pep in their step üòÅ

So far I've got some great reviews from my mentees which has been great validation that I'm really actually helping them out. I've scored a few of those cool badges in my short time too, like:

- Top 10 Mentors in Frontend Engineering
- Top 100 Mentors in UX Engineering

Maybe it's a vanity metric lol but kinda fun.

### Let's do a session! üòé
