### Sharing My Story

I got to join Kelly Carlson, the lovely creator and host of the One Bad Habit Podcast, to talk about my jagged path to tech as a self-taught designer and engineer. Kelly's podcast focuses on achieving the life you want by focusing on the power of habits, and how taking things one habit at a time can snowball into drastic change.

In this episode, Kelly guides me as I walk through some of my experiences trying to figure out my ideal career. From a healthcare career to freelance photography, to night classes for nursing school prerequisites, and all the way back around to learning to code - I was honored to get to share my story and to offer up encouragement to anyone on a similar uncertain path.

Check it out [here on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3HQQbKl9Nm5J19a4napHNK?si=7c505c5a981f4796), and show Kelly's podcast some love. I hope you enjoy it!
