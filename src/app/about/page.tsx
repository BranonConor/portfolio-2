          My love of people and my interest in the human experience are the
          driving forces in my life. That's why I got my degree in neuroscience
          and spent my first few years out of college as the director of a
          neuropsychiatric clinic.

        <Text as="p" mb={4}>
          Nowadays, I specialize in design + engineering in design systems,
          accessibility, prototyping, and general frontend product work. I love
          flexing creativity and systems-level thinking in building beautiful
          and intuitive interfaces, and in constructing world-class design
          systems + component libraries.

        <Text as="p" mb={8}>
          Outside of my main roles, I build fullstack web apps, create Udemy
          software development courses for tens of thousands of students, do web
          design/development for small businesses, and much more!
